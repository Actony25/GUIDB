<h1>Project Overview</h1>
<p>This version of the project simply has a javaFx project connected to a derby database. <br/> 
The end product is a window that pops up with a connect button. Once the button is clicked, a predefined SQL <br/>
statement is ran through the database and a first name and last name is printed. </p>
